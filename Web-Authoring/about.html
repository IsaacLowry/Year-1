	<p>Welcome to the Dundee University Computing Society (DUCS) website.
	This society was created for computing students to meet, socialise and learn a bit
	about computing at our events which take place all throughout the year. Join the society and you will be able to attend
	events such as the annual ball, tech meetups and our 24 hour hackathons which is sponsored by companies,
	giving you more opportunities in the computing industry.
	</p>
	
	<br>

	<p>DUCS constantly have events happening throughout the year for students to participate in to learn more about the technology industry or just 
	to meet new people. Past events that have taken place this past couple of months are the pub crawl, the pool night that took place in 
	the union and most notably the Quackathon.

	Dundee is famous for its games industry (GTA, Lemmings, Minecraft and Crackdown), the society has been very popular 
	among students which has helped keep DUCS running for a few years now.

	If you are wanting to join the society, all links and information about joining is on the membership page where 
	you can sign up by filling a form and paying Â£1 or you can visit our facebook page and find out more about DUCS</p>
